"""The subset of the .NET runtime identifier graph that rules_dotnet configures on.

`RUNTIME_GRAPH` is the full NuGet RID catalogue. Many of its entries name a
specific distribution release -- `ubuntu.16.04-x64`, `alpine.3.10-arm64` -- the
part of the graph .NET ignores under `UseRidGraph=false`. rules_dotnet declares
a build setting only for the portable RIDs and folds the rest onto their nearest
portable ancestor with `to_portable_rid`.

That is safe as long as the portable set is closed under compatibility and every
version-qualified RID has a portable ancestor. `rids.bzl` is regenerated from
upstream, so both properties are asserted in
`//dotnet/private/tests/portable_rids`.

The full graph is still used where the result is not a Bazel configuration:
validating what a package ships, and the RID fallback list in a self-contained
app's deps.json.
