Usage: dotnet run -- <sdk-folder> [generator ...]

Generators (all of them when none are named):
  versions      versions.bzl    -- available SDK versions   (network)
  rids          rids.bzl        -- the runtime identifier graph (network)
  packs         pack_bands.bzl  -- targeting/runtime/apphost pack bands (network)
  frameworks    frameworks.bzl  -- supported frameworks and C# language versions
  paket         paket.dependencies, dotnet-tools.json -- pin the Paket CLI

Naming a subset is useful because the networked generators take minutes and
rewrite files that are unrelated to whatever you are actually changing.
