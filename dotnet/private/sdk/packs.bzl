"""The NuGet packs that back each target framework.

A .NET release publishes its packs under a handful of predictable names, so
`PACK_BANDS` only has to pin the version each target framework resolves to and
which runtime identifiers that release shipped. The pack ids, the set of
targets, and the tables the pack transitions read are all derived from it.

`netstandard` and .NET Framework are frozen reference assemblies rather than
release packs, so their versions are literals here.
