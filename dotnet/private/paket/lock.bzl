"""Parser for Paket's `paket.lock` files.

`paket.lock` is the output of Paket's resolver: it pins an exact version for
every package in every dependency group, along with the feeds they were
resolved from. That is everything the module extension needs, because the
remaining package metadata (per-framework dependencies, targeting pack
overrides, framework lists and dotnet tools) is read out of the `.nupkg`
itself when it is fetched.

The file is line oriented and indentation sensitive:

    STORAGE: NONE
    RESTRICTION: == net10.0
    NUGET
      remote: https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json
        Argu (6.2.3)
          FSharp.Core (>= 4.3.2)
    GROUP Build
