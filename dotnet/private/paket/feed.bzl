"""Resolves NuGet package hashes from the feeds a lock file points at.

Paket does not record package hashes, so there is nothing in `paket.lock` to
pin a download against. NuGet V3 feeds publish the hash of every package as
part of their registration metadata, so the extension looks it up once and
hands it back to Bazel as a fact, which keeps it in `MODULE.bazel.lock` for
every later build to reuse and for reviewers to see.

Feeds that do not serve registration metadata simply yield no hash. The
packages are still pinned to an exact version by the lock file; they are just
not verified against a recorded digest.
