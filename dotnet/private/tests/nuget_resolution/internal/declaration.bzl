    Stating no expectations at all is how a test says the package resolves to
    nothing, which is different from it being incompatible.

    Args:
      name: What the test asserts, as a sentence.
      files: Every file the package ships.
      target_framework: The framework being built. Defaults to net8.0.
      runtime_identifier: The RID being built. Defaults to linux-x64.
      contents: Contents for the files that are parsed rather than listed.
      expected_refs: The assemblies the compiler references.
      expected_libs: The assemblies that end up next to the binary.
      expected_native: The native libraries that end up next to the binary.
      expected_analyzers: Language agnostic analyzers.
      expected_analyzers_csharp: C# analyzers.
      expected_analyzers_fsharp: F# analyzers.
      expected_analyzers_vb: VB analyzers.
      expected_resource_assemblies: Localized satellite assemblies.
      expected_content_files: The `contentFiles` a package ships. They are not
        resolved per framework, so a test asserting on them asserts nothing else.
      expected_tools: The files a package offers `dotnet tool`, keyed by the
        framework they sit under. Read straight off the archive, so a test
        asserting on them asserts nothing else.
      expected_framework_list: Assembly versions a targeting pack declares.
      expected_targeting_pack_overrides: Packages a targeting pack supersedes.
      expect_incompatible: The package supports nothing that can be built here,
        which is an error rather than a package that brings nothing. Asserts
        only that, so no other expectation can be stated alongside it.
      default_configuration: Resolve without a framework transition in front,
        the way anything reaching the package from outside the .NET rules does.
        There is no framework or RID to name, and only `expected_libs` is read.
