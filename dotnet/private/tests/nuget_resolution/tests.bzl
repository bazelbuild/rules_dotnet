"""Every NuGet resolution test.

A test is one declaration: the files a package ships, the framework and runtime
identifier to build at, and what should come out. Each one carries its own
layout and gets its own package in the fixture repository, so nothing has to be
published to add a case.

Everything that turns these into targets lives in `internal/`.
